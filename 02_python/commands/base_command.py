TODO 3-1: The BaseCommand class has a show_usage method implemented, but the execute method is not 
implemented and is passed on to the child class. Think about why this difference is made.

Answer (You may write your answer in either Korean or English):
While show_usage method works same in every command, execute method works differently in each command.
That is reason why show_usage method is implemented in BaseCommand class but execute method is not.
While execute function works differently in each command, every command needs same function, 
we leave execute function as abstract method.

TODO 3-2: The update_current_path method of the BaseCommand class is slightly different from other methods. 
It has a @classmethod decorator and takes a cls argument instead of self. In Python, this is called a 
class method, and think about why it was implemented as a class method instead of a normal method.

Answer (You may write your answer in either Korean or English):
If we use update_current_path method, we have to change all the current_path of all the instances of BaseCommand class.
To do that, we have to implement as a class method instead of a normal method.
